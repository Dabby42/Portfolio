This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Portfolio 

This is a portfolio website that describes a Web developer. It was my first trial utilizing react. 3 of the pages are served correctly which are the service page, about page and also the contact form. When visiting this site, the service page serves as the homepage. 

You can visit the deployed app, at https://Dabby42.github.io/Portfolio
